Of course, I will not post the Gerber file, because I do not know if it is necessary, but the scheme was developed in EasyEDA version 6.5.40. 

Perhaps I will add something else to the schemes or just add new schemes for the project, but this is not accurate)

The project has the following schemes:
- `Power Scheme` (on `Traco TEN 8-2411WI`),
- `Microcontroller` (on `ATMEGA 328-AU`, for firmware there is `AVR ISP` and `UART`), 
- `MicroSD` (on `74HC125`), 
- `RS-485` (on `MAX485` with tightening resistors for low, high interference and echo protection in a long wire).

And here it is board:
